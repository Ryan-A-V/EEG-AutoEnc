# How to Use:
## Required Libraries
I recommend using the provided conda environment file, but if you would like to install the libraries yourself, the ones needed are as follows:
  - Numpy
  - Scipy
  - matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - Tensorflow
  - mne
  - pyflac
The following are optional (required for running non-necessary portions of the repo):
  - mtrf
## Run and Compare Models
To run models, run "python testing_script.py MODEL_NAME [MODEL_NAME...] NUM_EPOCHS"
